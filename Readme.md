Unit Testing and E2E Tests

### Unit Tests

An Unit Test is the process of testing the smallest functional unit of a code, like a simple math function where we can check if 1+2 is returning 3, for example.<br/>
In this project, Unit Tests were added to FormButton and FormInput components (check __tests__)

### E2E Test

E2E or End-to-End tests are meant to simulate a real user testing the project, so, unlike unit tests, it won't matter if data coming from an API is correct, but rather check if all interactive stuff is actually interactive.<br/>
E2E Test added to index screen (check test.yaml)
